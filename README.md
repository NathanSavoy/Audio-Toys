Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to check out my little project. I hope 
you find something here of interest, whether you were sent here by my resume,
LinkedIn, or somewhere else.

The purpose of this project is to create a platform for my personal study of 
and experimentation with standard signal processing processes and algorithms.
Ultimately, I have created a self-contained GUI application which employs
the methods of Fourier Analysis and linear regression to perform time-
frequency analysis, tempo determination, and key determination, as well as
providing a notion of the song's loudness. 

The Krumhansl-Shmuckler algorithm with Bellman-Budge key weights is used with
moderate success, providing a further application of my home-brewed Windowed-
Fourier Transform algorithm, with it's ability to separate amplitude data 
into an arbitrary number of frequeny bands.

Being the largest software project that I have undertaken to date, I have
gained exposure to topics including version control, clean coding, GUI design,
and much else that goes into the creation a software product. 

As my primary goal is to learn, I welcome and feedback on my design or coding
practices, or anything else that stands out to you. If you have any questions
or would like to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at 
nsavoy7@gmail.com.

I hope you enjoy, and am look forward to hearing from you!

Cheers,

Nate
