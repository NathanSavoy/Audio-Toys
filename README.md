Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to check out my little project. I hope 
you find something here of interest, whether you were sent here by my resume,
or stumbled upon this all on your own. 

The purpose of this project is to create a platform for my personal study of 
and experimentation with standard signal processing processes and algorithms.
Ultimately, the plan is to create a simple, stripped-back application which
recreates the primary features of some common DJ analysis programs.

The primary features are driven by the Windowed Fourier Transform for time-
frequency analysis, and linear regression for tempo determination. Determination
of the song's key will rely on frequency spectrum analysis and a good deal of
music theory.

Putting this project together also provides an opportunity for me to practice
and demonstrate my knowledge of software development more generally, including
the architecture of a "shippable" program, and the construction of a basic GUI.

I hope you enjoy, and have yourself a wonderful day!

Cheers,

Nate
